## 영작
I actually went to Starbucks yesterday. Late at night probably 9:30
사실은 어제 스타벅스에 갔었어요. 밤늦게 9시 30분쯤?

I was going to Seoul with a car. Maybe at 3?

Surprisingly, there were seriously many cars. I barely arrived at around 6. It was totally exhausting.

Honestly, I wanted to take a break. Right away, I went to eat dinner.
